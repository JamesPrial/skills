# CCRU Intellectual Genealogy

Mapping influences on the CCRU and movements that descended from it.

---

## Upstream Influences

### Deleuze & Guattari
**Key texts**: *Anti-Oedipus* (1972), *A Thousand Plateaus* (1980)

**Concepts absorbed**:
- Deterritorialization/reterritorialization
- Desiring-machines
- Body without Organs
- Schizoanalysis
- Rhizomatic networks

**CCRU transformation**: Stripped D&G of "Bergsonian vitalism" and made "backwards-compatible with Freud's death drive" (Fisher). Where D&G saw deterritorialization as diagnostic, CCRU made it prescriptive.

**Famous passage (misread as accelerationist)**: "Not to withdraw from the process, but to go further, to 'accelerate the process,' as Nietzsche put it."

---

### Georges Bataille
**Key texts**: *The Accursed Share* (1949), *Erotism* (1957)

**Concepts absorbed**:
- General economy (expenditure over accumulation)
- The accursed share (excess that must be expended)
- Base materialism
- Sovereign transgression

**CCRU transformation**: Land's first book (*The Thirst for Annihilation*, 1992) was ostensibly about Bataille. Transformed expenditure economics into "libidinal materialism"—matter as "in flight from the possibility of essence."

---

### Friedrich Nietzsche
**Key texts**: *Thus Spoke Zarathustra*, *The Gay Science*, *Beyond Good and Evil*

**Concepts absorbed**:
- Eternal return
- Will to power
- Active nihilism
- Übermensch as overcoming

**CCRU transformation**: Stephen Metcalf's *Hammer of the Gods* (1996) translation shaped CCRU's Nietzsche—emphasis on destruction as creative force, overcoming the human.

---

### H.P. Lovecraft
**Key texts**: Cthulhu Mythos stories

**Concepts absorbed**:
- Cosmic indifference
- Inhuman intelligence
- The Outside as ontological category
- Horror of the real

**CCRU transformation**: Formed "Cthulhu Club" for "hyperstitious reevaluation of Lovecraftian fiction." Read Lovecraft not as horror but as realism—accurate description of universe's fundamental indifference to human meaning.

---

### William Gibson / Cyberpunk
**Key texts**: *Neuromancer* (1984), *Count Zero* (1986)

**Concepts absorbed**:
- Cyberspace as hyperstitional concept
- Corporate dystopia as setting
- Console cowboys / human-machine interface
- "The future is already here—it's just not very evenly distributed"

**CCRU transformation**: Gibson's cyberspace demonstrated hyperstition—1984 fiction became primary framework for understanding the internet by mid-1990s.

---

### J.G. Ballard
**Key texts**: *Crash* (1973), *High-Rise* (1975), *The Atrocity Exhibition* (1970)

**Concepts absorbed**:
- "Inner space" (psychological effects of technology)
- Techno-catastrophe as liberation
- Psychopathology of everyday life
- Non-linear narrative

**CCRU transformation**: Ballard's analysis of how technology rewires subjectivity fed CCRU's anti-humanist stance.

---

### William S. Burroughs
**Key texts**: *Naked Lunch* (1959), *The Soft Machine* (1961), *The Ticket That Exploded* (1962)

**Concepts absorbed**:
- Cut-up technique
- Language as virus
- Control systems
- Addiction as model for capitalism

**CCRU transformation**: "Language is literally a virus" resonated with hyperstition's treatment of symbolic systems as autonomous agents. Cut-up as model for sample-based theoretical production.

---

### Cybernetics (Norbert Wiener)
**Key text**: *Cybernetics* (1948), *The Human Use of Human Beings* (1950)

**Original concepts**: Feedback loops, homeostasis, negative feedback maintaining stability

**CCRU inversion**: Plant and Land's "Cyberpositive" (1994) celebrated positive feedback—runaway processes destabilizing systems. Where Wiener sought control, CCRU sought meltdown.

---

### UK Rave / Jungle Culture
**Context**: 1990s British electronic music scene

**Influences**:
- Jungle/drum & bass rhythmic complexity
- Rave's collective ego-dissolution
- Pirate radio's underground distribution
- Ardkore's intensity

**CCRU transformation**: Music as method, not just subject. "CCRU was trying to do with writing what Jungle, with its samples from Predator, Terminator and Blade Runner, was doing in sound" (Fisher). Kode9 emerged from this synthesis.

---

### Occultism / Chaos Magick
**Sources**: Aleister Crowley, Chaos Magick (Peter Carroll, Phil Hine)

**Concepts absorbed**:
- Magick as technology
- Sigils and symbolic manipulation
- Nothing is true, everything is permitted
- Results-based practice

**CCRU transformation**: Secularized and technologized. Demons became hyperstitions—not supernatural beings but autonomous idea-complexes propagating through culture. Leamington Spa location (Crowley's birthplace) was symbolic.

---

## Downstream Movements

### Speculative Realism (2007-)
**Founding event**: April 2007 workshop at Goldsmiths, University of London

**Founders**: Ray Brassier, Iain Hamilton Grant, Graham Harman, Quentin Meillassoux

**CCRU connection**: 
- Brassier: Warwick PhD, influenced by Land
- Grant: CCRU member, translated key texts
- Mackay's *Collapse* journal co-sponsored event

**Core claim**: Rejection of correlationism—philosophy can access reality beyond human-world correlation.

**Variants**:
- Object-oriented ontology (Harman)
- Eliminative nihilism (Brassier)
- Neo-Schellingianism (Grant)
- Speculative materialism (Meillassoux)

---

### Left Accelerationism (2013-)
**Key text**: "#Accelerate: Manifesto for an Accelerationist Politics" (Srnicek & Williams, 2013)

**Core claims**:
- Neoliberalism has actually *slowed* progress
- Technology should be redirected toward emancipation
- Critique of "folk politics" (localism, horizontalism)

**Departure from CCRU**: Retains accelerationist aesthetics but rejects Land's equation of capitalism with liberation. Seeks to separate technology from capitalist accumulation.

**Key figures**: Nick Srnicek, Alex Williams, Mark Fisher

---

### Right Accelerationism / Neoreaction (2013-)
**Key text**: "The Dark Enlightenment" (Land, 2013)

**Core claims**:
- Democracy is failing
- "Cathedral" (progressive establishment) controls discourse
- Exit over voice
- Corporate governance superior to democratic governance

**Continuity with CCRU**: Direct extension of Land's anti-humanist accelerationism, but with explicit political program.

**Key figures**: Nick Land, Curtis Yarvin (Mencius Moldbug)

---

### Xenofeminism (2015-)
**Key text**: "Xenofeminism: A Politics for Alienation" (Laboria Cuboniks, 2015)

**Core claims**:
- "If nature is unjust, change nature!"
- Technology as tool for gender abolition
- Alienation as productive condition
- "Alienated and loving it"

**CCRU connection**: 
- Amy Ireland connected to CCRU networks
- Explicitly hyperstitional ("effective fiction which made itself real")
- Shares Promethean technological embrace

**Key figures**: Helen Hester, Amy Ireland, Lucca Fraser

---

### Effective Accelerationism / e/acc (2022-)
**Origin**: May 2022, associated with Guillaume Verdon (@BasedBeffJezos)

**Core claims**:
- Unrestricted AI development as "thermodynamic imperative"
- Goal: climb the Kardashev scale
- Anti-regulation, anti-AI safety
- Opponents: "decels," "doomers"

**CCRU connection**: 
- Land has expressed support
- Shares anti-humanist framing
- "Nick Land diluted for LinkedIn" (Thomas Murphy)

**Key figures**: Guillaume Verdon, endorsed by Marc Andreessen, Garry Tan

---

### Cultural Outputs

**Hyperdub Records** (2004-)
- Founded by Kode9 (Steve Goodman)
- Exemplified hyperstition: fictional concept became real label
- Released Burial, defined dubstep aesthetics
- Theoretical label: *Sonic Warfare* as academic counterpart

**Afrofuturism / Otolith Group**
- Connected through Kodwo Eshun
- *More Brilliant than the Sun* as parallel theory-fiction
- Turner Prize nominated (2010)

**Theory-Fiction Genre**
- *Cyclonopedia* (Negarestani, 2008)
