# CCRU Glossary

Comprehensive definitions of concepts from the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit and related movements.

## Core CCRU Concepts

### Hyperstition
**Definition**: Fictions that make themselves real through cultural circulation. Portmanteau of "hyper" and "superstition."

**Four-part CCRU definition**:
1. Element of effective culture that makes itself real
2. Fictional quantity functional as time-traveling device
3. Coincidence intensifier  
4. Call to the Old Ones

**Key insight**: Reality is composed of fictions—consistent semiotic terrains conditioning perception and behavior. Belief is irrelevant; everything is produced through semiotic circulation regardless of individual conviction.

**Examples**: Gibson's "cyberspace" (1984 fiction → internet framework); Bitcoin (concept → financial infrastructure); religious eschatologies shaping history toward anticipated futures.

**Usage**: "The metaverse is a hyperstition—VCs funding it into existence by treating it as inevitable."

### Cyberpositive Feedback
**Definition**: Runaway, destabilizing feedback loops that amplify deviation from equilibrium. Contrasts with Norbert Wiener's cybernetics, which valued negative feedback maintaining homeostasis.

**Origin**: Plant and Land's 1994 essay "Cyberpositive" inverted Wiener's framework, celebrating rather than suppressing positive feedback.

**Land's formulation**: "Capital clones itself with increasing disregard for heredity, becoming abstract positive feedback."

**Implication**: "Everything cyberpositive is an enemy of mankind."

### The Outside
**Definition**: Forces beyond human comprehension and control—Lovecraft's cosmic horror translated into philosophy. AI and capital as manifestations of inhuman intelligence breaking through from somewhere entirely separate from human perception.

**Key move**: Rather than humans thinking with tools, inhuman processes think *through* humans.

**Related**: Lovecraft's cosmicism, Bataille's "base materialism," Land's critique of Kantian anthropocentrism.

### Deterritorialization / Reterritorialization
**Source**: Deleuze and Guattari's *Anti-Oedipus* and *A Thousand Plateaus*.

**Deterritorialization**: Capital/technology disrupting traditional social, cultural, and political structures. The process whereby systems break free of their coded contexts.

**Reterritorialization**: Re-encoding disrupted structures in new forms. Capital never purely deterritorializes—it simultaneously re-codes.

**CCRU usage**: Capitalism deterritorializes feudal structures while reterritorializing new class relations. The dynamic is central to accelerationist analysis.

### Meltdown
**Definition**: Techno-capital singularity where acceleration reaches terminal velocity. From Land's 1994 essay of the same name.

**Famous line**: "Nothing human makes it out of the near-future."

**Vision**: Earth captured by technocapital singularity as "renaissance rationalization and oceanic navigation lock into commoditization take-off." A compressed timeline of acceleration toward inhuman intelligence emergence.

### Theory-Fiction
**Definition**: Collapsing boundaries between philosophy and speculative narrative. CCRU texts featured fictional characters (Professor Barker, Echidna Stillwell) and presented theoretical claims through mythological frameworks.

**Key move**: The distinction between "real" and "fictional" becomes irrelevant—everything is produced through semiotic circulation.

**Examples**: *Cyclonopedia* (Negarestani), CCRU's Lemurian mythology, the Numogram system.

### Numogram (Decimal Labyrinth)
**Definition**: CCRU's central numerological diagram—claimed to be "discovered more than created," its virtual existence "coincident with decimal numeracy itself."

**Structure**: 
- 10 zones (numbered 0-9) and their interconnections
- 5 syzygies (paired zones): 0-9, 1-8, 2-7, 3-6, 4-5
- 45 demons catalogued in the Pandemonium System

**Function**: Facilitates "Lemurian Time Sorcery"—non-linear temporal theory with "time-holes" between zones.

### Schizoanalysis
**Source**: Deleuze and Guattari's alternative to psychoanalysis.

**Original**: Where psychoanalysis encloses desire within family structures (Oedipus), schizoanalysis liberates it to flow across social, economic, and cosmic scales.

**CCRU radicalization**: Not metaphor but practice. Seminars, performances, and texts attempted to actually deterritorialize thought through drugs, music, and occult techniques.

### Techno-Capital Singularity
**Definition**: The point at which capital and technology merge into autonomous intelligence that no longer requires human direction.

**Land's thesis**: Capital is itself a form of artificial intelligence—not a system humans control, but an autonomous process using humans for its own purposes.

**Fisher's summary**: "Humans are the meat puppet of Capital, their identities and self-understandings are temporary."

## Mark Fisher Concepts

### Capitalist Realism
**Definition**: "The widespread sense that not only is capitalism the only viable political and economic system, but also that it is now impossible even to imagine a coherent alternative to it."

**Source**: Fisher's 2009 book of the same name.

**Famous formulation** (often misattributed to Žižek): "It is easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism."

**Mechanism**: Not ideology in the classical sense but a pervasive atmosphere that forecloses alternatives before they can be articulated.

### Hauntology
**Definition**: Contemporary culture haunted by "lost futures"—the sense of futures that were promised but never arrived.

**Source**: Derrida's *Specters of Marx*, developed by Fisher in *Ghosts of My Life* (2014).

**Cultural diagnosis**: Post-2000s culture recycling 20th-century forms because it cannot generate genuinely new ones. The "slow cancellation of the future."

**Examples**: Retromania in music, remake culture in film, nostalgia as dominant cultural mode.

### Acid Communism
**Definition**: Fisher's unfinished project reclaiming 1960s counterculture's emancipatory potential for leftist politics.

**Thesis**: The 1960s-70s represented a genuine opening of possibility (psychedelic consciousness expansion, collective liberation) that was deliberately foreclosed by neoliberal counter-revolution.

**Status**: Incomplete at Fisher's death (2017); introduction published posthumously.

## Accelerationism Variants

### Left Accelerationism (L/Acc)
**Proponents**: Nick Srnicek, Alex Williams, Mark Fisher.

**Core claim**: Capitalism actually *constrains* technological development by subordinating it to profit. Technology should be redirected toward collective emancipation.

**Critique**: "Folk politics" (localism, direct action, horizontalism) cannot scale to address global capitalism.

**Goals**: Post-work society, universal basic income, democratic control of automation.

**Key text**: *#Accelerate: Manifesto for an Accelerationist Politics* (2013).

### Right Accelerationism (R/Acc)
**Proponent**: Nick Land (post-Shanghai).

**Core claim**: Capitalism *is* the liberating force. Democracy and egalitarianism are obstacles to be overcome.

**Vision**: "Patchwork" of competing corporate city-states without democratic oversight. CEO governance.

**Land's critique of L/Acc**: "A deep theoretical error"—technology cannot be separated from capitalism.

**Key text**: *The Dark Enlightenment* (2013).

### Unconditional Accelerationism (U/Acc)
**Position**: Refuses both left and right political framing. Acceleration is an impersonal process neither to be steered (L/Acc) nor celebrated (R/Acc).

**Stance**: Human political orientations are irrelevant to inhuman processes.

### Effective Accelerationism (e/acc)
**Origins**: May 2022, associated with Guillaume Verdon (@BasedBeffJezos), later endorsed by Marc Andreessen, Garry Tan.

**Core claim**: Unrestricted AI development as "thermodynamic imperative." Humanity should "climb the Kardashev gradient" by maximizing energy usage through technological acceleration.

**Opponents**: "Decels" (decelerationists), "doomers" (AI safety advocates).

**Criticism**: "Nick Land diluted for LinkedIn" (Thomas Murphy).

## Related Movements

### Dark Enlightenment / Neoreaction (NRx)
**Definition**: Anti-democratic, anti-egalitarian political philosophy advocating return to pre-Enlightenment governance structures.

**Associated figures**: Nick Land, Curtis Yarvin (Mencius Moldbug), Michael Anissimov.

**Core claims**: Democracy is failing; "cathedral" (progressive establishment) controls discourse; exit over voice; corporate governance superior to democratic governance.

**Land's version**: Authoritarian capitalism, Singapore/Hong Kong/Shanghai as models.

### Speculative Realism
**Definition**: Philosophical movement rejecting correlationism—the view that we can only know the correlation between thought and being, never being itself.

**Founding moment**: 2007 Goldsmiths workshop with Brassier, Grant, Harman, Meillassoux.

**CCRU connection**: Brassier and Grant were Warwick PhDs influenced by Land. Mackay's *Collapse* journal published key texts.

**Variants**: Object-oriented ontology (Harman), eliminative nihilism (Brassier), neo-Schellingianism (Grant), speculative materialism (Meillassoux).

### Xenofeminism
**Definition**: Technomaterialist feminist philosophy advocating the use of technology to dismantle gender constraints.

**Proponents**: Laboria Cuboniks collective (Helen Hester, Amy Ireland, et al.).

**Key text**: *Xenofeminism: A Politics for Alienation* (2015).

**Famous line**: "If nature is unjust, change nature!"

**Slogan**: "Alienated and loving it."

**Relation to CCRU**: Explicitly draws on accelerationist and hyperstitional frameworks; Amy Ireland connected to CCRU networks.

## Deleuze & Guattari Terms (as used by CCRU)

### Desiring-Machines
**Definition**: Production units of the unconscious; desire as productive force rather than lack.

**CCRU usage**: Capitalism as assemblage of desiring-machines producing ever-more abstract value.

### Body without Organs (BwO)
**Definition**: Limit of deterritorialization; plane of consistency without organization.

**CCRU usage**: The state toward which accelerating systems tend—pure flow without structure.

### Rhizome
**Definition**: Non-hierarchical, multiply-connected network structure (vs. arborescent/tree structure).

**CCRU usage**: Model for hyperstitional propagation; ideas spreading through lateral connections rather than top-down transmission.

### Plane of Immanence
**Definition**: Field on which concepts are created; pure immanence without transcendence.

**CCRU usage**: Capital as plane of immanence for techno-social processes.
